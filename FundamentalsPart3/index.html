<!--
For now, just write each function and test the output with console.log:
Write a function called add7 that takes one number and returns that number + 7.
Write a function called multiply that takes 2 numbers and returns their product.
Write a function called capitalize that takes a string and returns that string with only the first letter capitalized. Make sure that it can take strings that are lowercase, UPPERCASE or BoTh.
Write a function called lastLetter that takes a string and returns the very last letter of that string: lastLetter("abcd") should return "d"
